# Choose-and-Chat: RAG-Based Multi-PDF Chatbot

This is a lightweight web application that allows users to **upload multiple PDF documents**, **select any one**, and **chat with it** using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

## Features

- Upload multiple PDF files.
- Select any one PDF to chat with.
- Ask natural language questions and get contextual answers.
- Backend powered by a custom RAG pipeline.
- Simple HTML interface (dark mode with orange accents).

## How It Works

1. PDFs are uploaded and indexed.
2. The user selects one document from the uploaded list.
3. When a question is asked, the RAG system retrieves relevant context from the chosen PDF.
4. The language model generates an accurate and contextual response.
